The undo and redo functionality (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y or Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z) behaves differently across browsers. Some browsers undo individual keystrokes, while others undo larger operations. The undo stack may also be cleared unexpectedly.

This scenario has been observed in multiple environments with similar behavior.
