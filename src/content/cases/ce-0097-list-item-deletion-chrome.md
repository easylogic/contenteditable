### Phenomenon

When pressing Backspace at the beginning of the first list item in Chrome, the list item is deleted and converted to a paragraph element. This behavior differs from Firefox and Safari, which may delete the entire list or create unexpected structures.

### Reproduction example

1. Create a list with at least one item: `<ul><li>Item 1</li><li>Item 2</li></ul>`
2. Place cursor at the very beginning of "Item 1" (before the text)
3. Press Backspace

### Observed behavior

- The first list item is removed from the list
- The list item content is converted to a `<p>` paragraph element
- The remaining list items stay in the list structure
- If it was the only item, the list may be removed entirely

### Expected behavior

- The list item should be deleted and merged with previous content (if any)
- Or the list item should be removed while maintaining list structure
- Behavior should be consistent across browsers

### Browser Comparison

- **Chrome/Edge**: Converts list item to paragraph
- **Firefox**: May delete entire list or create nested structures
- **Safari**: May create empty list items or unexpected structures

### Notes and possible direction for workarounds

- Intercept `beforeinput` events with `inputType: 'deleteContentBackward'`
- Check if cursor is at the beginning of a list item
- Implement custom deletion logic that maintains expected behavior
- Consider converting to paragraph only if there's previous content to merge with
