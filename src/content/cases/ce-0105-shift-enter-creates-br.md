## Phenomenon

When pressing Shift+Enter in a contenteditable element, a `<br>` line break element is created instead of a new paragraph. This behavior is consistent across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

## Reproduction example

1. Focus a contenteditable element
2. Type some text
3. Press Shift+Enter

## Observed behavior

- A `<br>` element is inserted
- Text continues on the next line without creating a new block element
- This is consistent across all major browsers
- Useful for line breaks within paragraphs

## Expected behavior

- Shift+Enter should create a line break (current behavior is correct)
- Enter should create a new paragraph/block
- Behavior should be consistent (which it is)

## Browser Comparison

- **All browsers**: Shift+Enter creates `<br>` consistently
- This is expected and correct behavior

## Notes and possible direction for workarounds

- This behavior is generally correct and expected
- May need to handle edge cases where `<br>` is in unexpected contexts
- Consider normalizing multiple `<br>` elements if needed
- Ensure `<br>` is properly styled for line breaks
