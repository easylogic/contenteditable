<p>This is a very long paragraph that should wrap across multiple lines when the contenteditable area is resized. It contains enough text to demonstrate automatic line wrapping behavior in contenteditable elements. The text continues here to make it even longer so that we can observe how the browser handles line breaks and text wrapping in different scenarios.</p>
<p>Another long paragraph with continuous text that has no line breaks or special characters, just plain text flowing from one line to the next as the container width changes. This helps test how contenteditable handles word wrapping and text reflow when the user types or edits content.</p>
<p>Short paragraph.</p>
<p>This paragraph contains a mix of short and long words to test how the browser handles word breaking and wrapping. Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious is a very long word that might not break properly. Similarly, antidisestablishmentarianism is another example of a long word. These long words help test edge cases in text wrapping behavior.</p>
<p>Paragraph with formatting: <strong>This is bold text that should wrap properly</strong> and <em>this is italic text that also needs to wrap</em> within the same paragraph. The formatting should be preserved even when the text wraps to multiple lines.</p>
