# ⌨️ contenteditable.lab

> **A living catalog of `contenteditable` behavior across browsers, operating systems, and input methods.**

---

## Why This Project Exists

The `contenteditable` attribute is deceptively simple—add it to any HTML element and users can edit its contents. But beneath this simplicity lies a minefield of browser-specific quirks, OS-dependent behaviors, and IME complications that have frustrated developers for decades.

### The Reality of contenteditable

When you use `contenteditable` in production, you quickly discover that:

- **The same code behaves differently** across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- **IME (Input Method Editor) behavior** varies dramatically between Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Event sequences** (`beforeinput`, `input`, `compositionstart`, etc.) fire in different orders depending on the browser
- **Selection and Range APIs** have subtle but critical differences that break editor features
- **Undo/redo stacks** are cleared unexpectedly or don't include programmatic changes
- **Paste behavior** is inconsistent, sometimes preserving formatting, sometimes stripping it
- **Mobile browsers** introduce entirely new sets of quirks with touch interactions

These aren't edge cases—they're the daily reality of building rich text editors. Major projects like ProseMirror, Slate, and Lexical have spent years working around these issues, but their solutions are often proprietary or too complex for smaller projects.

**contenteditable.lab** exists to document these behaviors systematically so that:

- 🔍 **You can observe** — Real-world edge cases captured with precise reproduction steps and environment details
- 📚 **You can search** — Cases organized by environment (OS × Browser × Input Method) so you can find issues specific to your users
- 🧪 **You can reproduce** — Interactive playground to verify behaviors in your own environment before shipping code
- 📖 **You can learn** — Comprehensive documentation on events, Selection API, and proven workarounds

## What You'll Find Here

### 📋 Cases

Each case documents a specific `contenteditable` behavior observed in a particular environment. A case includes:

```
Case: ce-0002-ime-enter-breaks
├── Environment: Windows × Chrome × Korean IME
├── Title: Composition is cancelled when pressing Enter
├── Description: Detailed explanation of what happens and why
├── Reproduction Steps: Step-by-step instructions to trigger it
├── Expected Behavior: What should happen according to specs
├── Observed Behavior: What actually happens in this environment
├── Analysis: Technical explanation if known
├── DOM Steps: Visual representation of DOM changes
└── Status: confirmed (verified) / draft (needs verification)
```

**Why cases matter:** When a user reports "the editor breaks when I type Korean," you can search for cases with `Korean IME` tag and find the exact scenario, reproduction steps, and potential workarounds. Cases are searchable by:

- **OS** (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android)
- **Browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Device** (Desktop, Mobile, Tablet)
- **Keyboard layout** (US QWERTY, Korean IME, Japanese IME, etc.)
- **Tags** (ime, composition, selection, paste, undo, etc.)

### 🎭 Scenarios

Scenarios group related cases that describe the same phenomenon across different environments. This helps you understand:

1. **Which environments are affected** — Is this a Chrome-only issue or does it affect all browsers?
2. **Which environments need testing** — Are there gaps in our coverage?
3. **The scope of the problem** — Is this a universal issue or environment-specific?

**Example scenario:**

> **"IME composition cancelled on Enter"**
> 
> This scenario groups cases where pressing Enter during IME composition cancels the composition unexpectedly:
> - Windows + Chrome + Korean IME ✓ (confirmed)
> - macOS + Safari + Japanese IME ✓ (confirmed)
> - Linux + Firefox + Chinese IME ? (needs testing)
> - iOS Safari + Chinese IME ? (needs testing)

Each scenario page includes:
- **Description** of the phenomenon
- **Impact** on user experience and development
- **Browser comparison** showing which browsers are most/least affected
- **Workarounds** and solutions that have been tested
- **Related cases** with links to specific environment combinations
- **Graph visualization** showing relationships between cases, scenarios, and tags

### 🧪 Playground

## The Problem We're Solving

Building a rich text editor? You'll encounter questions like:

- *"Why does Enter behave differently in Safari?"* — Safari inserts `<div>` while Chrome inserts `<br>`, breaking your formatting logic
- *"Why does my Korean IME lose characters on certain key combos?"* — Composition events fire in different orders, causing character loss
- *"Why does paste formatting vary between browsers?"* — Chrome preserves HTML structure, Firefox strips it, Safari does something else entirely
- *"Why does undo/redo break after programmatic DOM changes?"* — The undo stack is cleared or doesn't include your changes, making undo/redo unreliable
- *"Why does my selection disappear after I wrap text in a `<strong>` tag?"* — Selection restoration is inconsistent across browsers
- *"Why does typing in a table cell break the table structure?"* — Table editing behavior varies dramatically between browsers
- *"Why does my code block lose indentation when users type?"* — Whitespace preservation in `<pre><code>` is unreliable

These aren't theoretical—they're real issues developers face daily. Each one can take hours or days to debug, often requiring:

1. **Reproducing the issue** in multiple browsers and OS combinations
2. **Understanding the event sequence** by adding extensive logging
3. **Finding workarounds** through trial and error or reading obscure forum posts
4. **Testing edge cases** to ensure the workaround doesn't break other features

**contenteditable.lab** collects these "incidents" with:
- **Exact reproduction steps** so you can verify the issue immediately
- **Environment details** so you know if it affects your users
- **Event logs** showing the exact sequence of events
- **Proven workarounds** that have been tested across environments
- **Related cases** so you can see if similar issues exist in other environments

You don't have to rediscover these problems the hard way.

## Philosophy

**Precision over assumptions.** Each case documents exactly what happens, not what "should" happen according to specs.

**Environment matters.** The same code produces different results on Windows Chrome vs macOS Safari vs mobile browsers. We capture these differences.

**Reproducibility is key.** Every case includes steps to reproduce. If you can't reproduce it, we refine the case until you can.

**Community-driven.** No single person has tested every OS × Browser × IME combination. This catalog grows through collective documentation.

## Tech Stack

This project is built with modern web technologies chosen for performance, developer experience, and maintainability:

- **[Astro](https://astro.build/)** — Static site generator that generates fast, SEO-friendly pages. Perfect for documentation sites with minimal JavaScript by default, while allowing React components where needed (like the Playground).

- **[React](https://react.dev/)** — Used for interactive components, specifically the Playground where real-time event monitoring and visualization require dynamic updates. React's component model makes it easy to manage complex state (event logs, snapshots, visualizations).

- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** — Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development. Enables consistent styling across the site and makes dark mode theming straightforward with CSS variables.

- **[React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/)** + **[Dagre](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre)** — Graph visualization library for displaying relationships between cases, scenarios, tags, and environments. Dagre provides automatic layout algorithms so the graphs are readable without manual positioning.

- **TypeScript** — Type safety across the entire codebase. Critical for maintaining correctness in a project with complex data structures (event logs, DOM snapshots, case metadata).

- **IndexedDB** — Client-side database for storing Playground snapshots. Allows users to save and restore editor states with full event context, even after page reloads. Snapshots are stored locally and don't require server infrastructure.
